1. I like being able to see changes made on files in github and the ability to get older versions.also, github desktop is so much easier to use and understand compared to just using terminal with github commands
2. I don't really like how confusing the branches are (although I understand them a little more now)
3. Does github deskptop have more functionality compared to just using terminal, or are there the same terminal commands that do the same things that are done in github desktop?
